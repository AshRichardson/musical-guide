<p class='instruction-block'>Thanks for completing the first interaction. <br />
When you click the 'Next' button you will be taken to a screen containing another interactive piano, that looks identical. Again, play on the piano by using your mouse/trackpad or using the keys on your keyboard. An AI will play along with you, however, this AI will use a different algorithm to generate responses. When you've had enough, press the 'Next' button to complete the final questionnaire.<br />
